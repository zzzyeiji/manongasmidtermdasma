      The City of Dasmariñas started as a barrio of Imus, and in 1867 it was made as an independent municipality. The Spanish Government named the town Perez de Dasmariñas in honor of the Spanish Governor General of the islands from 1590-1593. Perez Dasmariñas was well remembered because he was the one who initiated the fortification of Intramuros and Fort Santiago.

      Perez de Dasmariñas was formerly a “visita” of Imus, which was founded by the Recollect Fathers in 1795. The Camarin de Piedra owned by the Recolletos was used as the first church of Dasmariñas upon its division while the residents were constructing a new one. The first settlers arrived in 1861. The town of Dasmariñas became a bloody battlefield during the revolution in 1896-1897. After conquering the town on February 25, 1897, the Spaniards burned all the houses and buildings in the Poblacion except the Catholic Church. Hundreds of inhabitants died in the fighting. Noted Filipino Generals like Flaviano Yengko and Crispulo Aguinaldo died in action during the aforesaid encounter. In 1905, during the early American Regime, the town of Dasmariñas once again became a barrio of Imus and remained a part of the said town until 1907 when it was again made into a separate municipality during the incumbency of Provincial Governor Antero Soriano. In that year, the name Perez was dropped or deleted through the efforts of Placido Campos, Francisco Barzaga and Felipe Tirona.

      The growing congestion and outward urban expansion of the Metropolitan Manila Area has setup a favorable atmosphere for the development of the town. The changing dynamics of Dasmariñas from a traditional agricultural town to a fast urbanizing suburbia serve as a telltale sign of progress. Now, with a population of close to 700,000 people and the development of the resettlement areas, a new city was born. Dasmariñas at present showcases large educational and health institutions and an influx of industries and subdivisions, an inevitable development that truly makes this city first class.
